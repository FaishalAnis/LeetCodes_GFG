# Coding Practice Repository

This repository contains the solutions to various coding problems I have been practicing from **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**, **LeetCode**, and other coding platforms. The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of coding problems and their solutions that I have worked on, organized by the platform where the problem was found. This repository serves as a personal practice log to track my progress over time. The problems are primarily related to common algorithmic topics such as:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- Math and Number Theory

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/LeetCode**: Contains the solutions to problems from LeetCode.
- **/GeeksforGeeks**: Contains the solutions to problems from GeeksforGeeks.
- Each solution is named based on the problem (e.g., `two_sum.py`, `binary_tree_traversal.java`).
  
Feel free to explore the directories based on the platform or problem category.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-practice-repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the platform directory** (e.g., `/LeetCode` or `/GeeksforGeeks`):
    ```bash
    cd coding-practice-repository/LeetCode
    ```

3. **Run the desired solution**:
    - For Python problems:
      ```bash
      python problem1.py
      ```
    - For C++ problems:
      ```bash
      g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1
      ./problem1
      ```

4. **Follow the instructions in the code** (if any) to provide input and get the output.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you'd like to add new solutions, please follow the steps below:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a **new branch** for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b add-new-problem
    ```
4. Add your solution in the appropriate directory (`/LeetCode` or `/GeeksforGeeks`).
5. **Commit** your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add solution for problem XYZ"
    ```
6. **Push** your changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin add-new-problem
    ```
7. **Create a pull request** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.

Please ensure your code is well-commented, follows the correct coding standards, and includes test cases wherever possible.
